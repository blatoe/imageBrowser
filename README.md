# imageBrowser
With your reasonable request for a code sample, I decided to kill to birds with one stone and address some looming requests at work for an image based asset browser, to help with character model assembly and configuration, as well as support for a proper animation library.  My recent focus on content creation, so I've needed to familiarize myself with PySide2 bit, as well as explore some new areas of PyQt that should be a good start for an accessible ui for the character team. I've re-purposed some utility scripts that I often use, when trying to wrangle the ever growing number of files and folder structures.
